# SIP-CCET

A joint collaboration project with the University of Toronto's Social Innovation Project (SIP) and the Centre for Community Energy Transformation (CCET). As a group of student volunteers, we assisted the CCET in creating a dwelling type analysis, energy burden analysis, and represented findings in a GIS based manner.
